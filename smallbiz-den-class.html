      <p>
        When shipping freight, you may come across the acronym N.O.I. This standards for <strong>Not Otherwise Indicated.</strong> Not every item is classified by the National Motor Freight Classification index. In these cases, shippers may need to
        call
        for real-time NOI freight rating. If you’re unsure of your class, use our handy calculator below.

      <p>
        Freight rates are determined by several different factors including package dimensions, weight, distance and freight class, as well as your packages’ Pounds per Cubic Foot (PCF) or density. Your package’s PCF is closely related to the freight
        class that is applied to your freight shipment. A low PCF will result in a higher class rating. In turn, a higher class rating corresponds to a higher cost to ship your freight.
